Introduction 

Trackletics is a full-stack workout tracking application that allows users to track their physical activity and wellness. It is built whith a Flask backend and React frontend. It allows users to log in securely with session-based authentication, choose from a list of workouts or add their own, add health stats like calories burned, hydration, and soreness for specific workouts. The user can also view, edit, and delete only their own workouts and health stats.

Routes

Trackletics includes session-based auth routes and full CRUD routes for users, workouts, and health stats.

Authentication Routes
POST	/signup	- Register a new user
POST	/login	- Log in an existing user
GET	/check_session	- Get current logged-in user
DELETE	/logout	- Log out the current session

Workout & Stat Routes=

GET	/user_workouts	- Get current user's workouts
POST	/health_stats	- Add a new health stat to a workout
PATCH	/health_stats/<id>	- Edit a specific health stat
DELETE	/health_stats/<id>	- Delete a specific health stat

Models
Trackletics uses SQLAlchemy for ORM and includes four main models:
User - Has secure password storage via password hashing. 
Workout - Represents a global list of workout types. 
HealthStat - Contains fields such as calories_burned, hydration, and soreness.
All models are serialized with sqlalchemy-serializer.

Important Files (Backend)
app.py - Registers resources, initializes the session, and handles route error handling.
config.py 0 Centralizes app setup including: app instantiation, SQLAlchemy db, Flask-Migrate migrate, Flask-RESTful api, Flask-CORS setup, prevents circular imports and keeps configuration DRY and modular.
models.py - Defines SQLAlchemy models (User, Workout, UserWorkout, HealthStat), Includes relationships, validations, and serialization rules.
seed.py - Generates initial data for workouts and users using standard Python logic. 

Important Files (Frontend)
App.js - Main app wrapper that: Holds global state for user, workouts, and form visibility, Handles session check on load, Contains client-side routing using react-router-dom
Dashboard.js - Displays a userâ€™s selected workouts and the nested health stats for each workout, Renders components like WorkoutSelector and HealthStatCard.
WorkoutSelector.js - Allows users to select from global workout options or add a new workout, Uses dropdown UI with conditionally rendered input fields.
HealthStatCard.js - Displays a single health stat with calories and hydration, Includes buttons to edit or delete the stat, Conditionally renders an EditHealthStatForm.
HealthStatForm.js - Controlled form (using Formik) to add a new health stat, Fields include calories burned, hydration, and notes, Sends a POST request to the backend.
EditHealthStatForm.js - Similar to HealthStatForm, but allows updating an existing health stat, Prefilled values are tied to the selected stat and passed in via props.
